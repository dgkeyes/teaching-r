Datasets to use for teaching R. Geared toward those in social sciences and evaluation.

# Datasets

- [Lalonde](https://github.com/jjchern/lalonde): a dataset from a 1970s study on a worker training program
- [World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV6.jsp): "The World Values Survey (WVS) is a global research project that explores people’s values and beliefs, how they change over time and what social and political impact they have. It is carried out by a worldwide network of social scientists who, since 1981, have conducted representative national surveys in almost 100 countries." (Wikipedia)
- [California Health Interview Survey](http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/chis/Pages/default.aspx): "The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) is the nation's largest state health survey and a critical source of data on Californians as well as on the state's various racial and ethnic groups."

# Fake data
R packages to make fake datasets.

- [synthpop R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synthpop/synthpop.pdf): "A tool for producing synthetic versions of microdata containing confidential information so that they are safe to be released to users for exploratory analysis"
- [Wakefield R package](https://github.com/trinker/wakefield): Package to make fake datasets
- [OpenSDPsynthR](https://github.com/opensdp/OpenSDPsynthR): "A project to generate realistic synthetic unit-level longitudinal education data to empower collaboration in education analytics." A description of the data generated is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzA6GcmEs1BZTzFuY1ZBV3c5aUNfSkVVLXJTMmk4NjlwaV9n/view?usp=sharing).
- [Faketucky](https://github.com/opensdp/faketucky): "The Faketucky synthetic college-going analysis file contains high school and college outcome data for two graduating cohorts of approximately 40,000 students. There are no real children in the dataset, but it mirrors the relationships between variables present in real data."


# Collections of datasets
- [Rdatasets](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html): "Rdatasets is a collection of 1161 datasets that were originally distributed alongside the statistical software environment R and some of its add-on packages. The goal is to make these data more broadly accessible for teaching and statistical software development."

- [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday): "Join the R4DS online learning community in the weekly #TidyTuesday event! Every week we post a raw dataset, an original chart associated with that dataset, and ask you to apply your take on the chart. While the data set will be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy!"
